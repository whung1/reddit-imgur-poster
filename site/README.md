## Getting The Website Working

### Setting Up
First supply your own `auth.ini` files in `app/imgur_backend` and `app/reddit_backend` folders (example `auth_example.ini` files with proper format are provided) with your developer imgur and reddit ids and secrets

Then install necessary libraries using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` (which was generated by pipreqs)

### Running The Site

To run an instance of the website, use the command `python run.py`

## Unit Tests
Run `python tests_basic.py` or `python -m unittest tests_basic` or likewise for any other test files (e.g. `test_user.py`)
